My name is Zeng, Hanyu, and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Information Science at the [University of Pittsburgh (PITT)](https://www.pitt.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Zhou, Pengfei](https://zhoupf.github.io/) in [MINT lab](https://mintpitt.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer science, with a particular focus on Mobile AI, AI applications in healthcare, and the integration of Large Language Models in mobile contexts. At present, I am working on research related to insulin management for diabetes patients.

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Intelligent Systems from the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/) and dual Bachelor's degrees in Communication Engineering and Electronic Engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and the [University of Glasgow (UoG)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), respectively. Before joining the University of Pittsburgh, I worked as a Machine Learning Algorithm Engineer at [MEITUAN](https://www.meituan.com/).
